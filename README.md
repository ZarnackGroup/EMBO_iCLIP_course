# iCLIP2 EMBO course 2024

Welcome to the bioinformatics part of the course! 

We have two practical sessions for you.

## Practical 1 - Exploring CLIP data with the UCSC genome browser

We uploaded crosslink profiles of CSTF2 and SF3B1 to the UCSC genome browser for you. Have a look at https://genome.ucsc.edu/s/melinak/How_to_define_binding_iCLIP2_EMBO_course_bioinformatics_practial1. Go through the tasks below and make screen shots of the examples you find, so we can discuss your examples in the end.

- CSFT2 is a polyadenylation factor. Find some examples for crosslink peaks at polyadenylation sites and alternative polyadenylation sites. Are these sites also annotated in the genome annotation?
