# iCLIP2 EMBO course 2024

Welcome to the bioinformatics part of the course! 

We have two practical sessions for you.

## Practical 1 - Exploring CLIP data with the UCSC genome browser

We uploaded crosslink profiles of CSTF2 and SF3B1 to the UCSC genome browser for you. Have a look at https://genome.ucsc.edu/s/melinak/How_to_define_binding_iCLIP2_EMBO_course_bioinformatics_practial1. Go through the tasks below and make screen shots of the examples you find, so we can discuss your examples in the end.

- CSFT2 is a polyadenylation factor. Find some examples for crosslink peaks at polyadenylation sites and alternative polyadenylation sites. Are these sites also annotated in the genome annotation?

- For SF3B1 we uploaded the crosslinks from two different experiments: A very deep iCLIP2 experiment from Pacholewska *et al.* 2024 (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.26.576051) and a less deep eCLIP experiment from the ENCODE data base. Find some examples for overlaps and discrepacies of the crosslink profiles from both experiments.

- There are different methods to define binding sites CLIP data. We included in the session also crosslink peaks from PureCLIP, binding sites form BindingSiteFinder and enriched binding regions from DEW-seq. Another othen used tool for binding site definition is clipper. Clipper binding sites are also provided at the ENCODE data base for all ENCODE data sets. Add the clipper binding sites to the UCSC genome browser session (see instrcutions below) and compare the binding sites from the different methods.
